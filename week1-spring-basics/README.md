# 🌱 Week 1 – Spring Basics

Welcome to **Week 1** of my 12-month Spring mastery journey — #SpringWithTheo!  
This week, I focused on building a solid foundation in the **core principles of the Spring Framework**.

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- **What is Spring?** – A lightweight, open-source framework for building Java applications.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** – Delegating the responsibility of managing object lifecycles to the framework.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** – Automatically injecting required dependencies into classes.
- **Bean Configuration** – Using `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and understanding `ApplicationContext`.

---

## 💻 Mini Project

Built a simple Spring app demonstrating:

- Manual and annotation-based bean configuration
- Constructor and setter injection
- Basic `ApplicationContext` setup

> 📁 You’ll find the source code in the `/src` directory inside this folder.

## 🧠 Reflections

Starting from the ground up reminded me how powerful clean architecture is.  
I used to overlook how much control Spring gives you over object lifecycles — now it makes total sense.

## 📣 Accountability Challenge

Every week I post what I’ve learned on LinkedIn.  
**If I miss a Sunday post by 11 PM GMT**, the first person to tag me with  
**#SpringWithTheo** and **#NoPostNoPeace** wins **€50** — no questions asked!
