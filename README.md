# 🌱 Spring With Theo

Welcome to **#SpringWithTheo** — my 12-month deep dive into the entire Spring ecosystem.

Over the next year, I’ll be exploring **every major Spring project** — from Spring Boot to Spring Cloud, Spring Data,
Security, Batch, GraphQL, and more.  
Each week, I’ll study a topic, share what I’ve learned, and build a small project to apply it.

## 🧠 Why?

> “The game is consistency.”

If you want to live the life you desire, you have to adopt the habits of the person who already lives it.  
This is my journey of doing that — one week, one commit, one post at a time.

---

## 📅 Weekly Structure

- **Daily:** Minimum of 5 mins studying Spring (docs, videos, or projects)
- **Weekly:** Small project + LinkedIn recap post
- **Always:** At least one Git commit a day

## 📣 The Accountability Challenge

Here’s where **you** come in.

👉 If I don’t post a weekly update by **Sunday 11 PM GMT**, the first person to tag me with  
**#SpringWithTheo** and **#NoPostNoPeace** wins **€50** — no excuses, no delays, just PayPal/Revolut and vibes 🤣

To win:

- Share something *you’ve* learned or want to learn in tech
- Tag me with **#SpringWithTheo** and **#NoPostNoPeace**
- Drop a motivational word like “Keep going, Theo!”
