This is My first Week in my personal goal to learn all the frameworks available in Spring.

My aim is to an aspect of spring everyday and write at least 1 commit a day. 

Im currently learning spring basics and what's happening under hood by studying atlease 5 mins a day, and make 1 commit a day on what ive lean't detailing the process through work and documentation.

This Week I learn about the Spring Basics. I covered:
- IOC via the Spring context
- How to access and retrive from the context
- How to add to the context via Annotation and Java baeed configuration.
